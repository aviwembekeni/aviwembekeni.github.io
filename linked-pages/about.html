            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>Experienced Full Stack Developer with a demonstrated history of working in the computer software industry.
              Skilled in Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), Java, HTML, JavaScript, and React.

            </p>
            <p>
              I started coding in High School. From grade 8 to grade 9 we were using Scratch programme.
              Scratch is a simple programme with buttons that you can drag and fit together to create
              simple functions such as walking an oject across a screen. you use loops, motions, sounds e.t.c.
              From grade 10 to grade 12 we switched to java, then from grade 11 to grade 12 we used java with microsoft access as
              our data base. At the end of each year we used java and microsoft access to create applications
              for solving real life problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              In grade 10 I also joined a programme called GirlHype. The programmes's
              mission is to teach girls programming, which is funny because I'm a guy. Anyway I became the first guy to join
              the programme and invited my friends to attend with me. Joining the programme led to me meeting Reza Ismail,
              A software developer at old mutual back then. He was teaching us coding in java. fast forward, 2 years later
              I became a full stack developer at his friend's company, DevDream Digital. The year before, while I was doing
              my Grade 12 I became a software tester at his other friend's company, EduTree.
